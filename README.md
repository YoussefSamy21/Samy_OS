# SamyOS
Samy OS is a Real-Time Operating System written from scratch, targeting
Embedded Systems Applications.It is Built on the ARM CMSIS V5 Library for easy porting and simple software re-use. 

```ðŸ’¡ Please Note that this Project is made for educational and learning purposes, trying to better my understanding of Real-Time Operating Systems.```

``` As such, it may contain imperfections or faults that I have yet to discover.So if you spot an issue or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request.```

``` ðŸ“Œ Looking ahead, I am planning to continuously refine and enhance this project, adding new features and addressing any identified faults. ```


## OS Feautres:
1) **Pre-emptive Scheduler:** SamyOS is a Priority based scheduler, supporting **Round-Robin** scheduling algorithm for same priority tasks. 

2) **Reduced Power Consumption:** SamyOS Consumes **8%** of the Cortex-M3 CPU Utilization in the idle State, where no tasks are running. <br /> 
This is mainly achieved by the "WFE" (wait for event) ARM Instruction which causes CPU entry to Sleep Mode when no tasks are running (Idle State).

3) **Tasks Synchronization:** SamyOS supports Mutex, which allows a task to enter in the waiting state for an acquired Mutex, and directly be Activated once the Mutex is released.

4) **Priority Ceiling:** SamyOS implements a simple Priority Ceiling technique, which helps in avoiding Priority Inversion Problem.

5) **Flexible Tasks Activation/Termination:** SamyOS supports running the tasks periodically, it also allows the user to Activate/Terminate tasks in run-time.  

## Test Cases:
Several test cases were covered on ARM Keil uvision, with Systick = 1ms and STM32F103C8 (Cortex-M3 microcontroller). Here are some of them:

#### 1) Round-Robin Scheduling 3 Tasks having the Same Priority:

![Round-Robin](https://github.com/YoussefSamy21/Samy_OS/blob/main/Keil%20Simulation/Case_1_Round_Robin.gif)

#### 2) Running 3 Tasks **Periodically**: (task1 every 100ms), (task2 every 300ms), (task3 every 500ms).

#### 3) CPU Utilization = 8% , in the Idle State. (No running tasks)

## User Supported APIs:
- **`Samy_OS_Init`**: Creates the OS Main Stack Boundaries, Buffer, and Configure the Idle-Task.

- **`Samy_OS_Create_Task`**: Create the Task's Stack Boundaries Region and Adds the Task in the Scheduling table.

- **`Samy_OS_Start_OS`**: Starts the OS Systick timer, to begin scheduling the tasks, starts running the idle task.

- **`Samy_OS_Activate_Task`**: Moves the Task to the Ready State (added to Ready QUEUE).

- **`Samy_OS_Terminate_Task`**: Moves the Task to the Suspended State.

- **`Samy_OS_Task_Wait`**: Sends the Task to the Waiting state, according to the desired time.

- **`Samy_OS_Acquire_Mutex`**: Acquire Mutex if available.

- **`Samy_OS_Release_Mutex`**: Release Mutex and acquires it to the other task waiting for that Mutex (if found).
